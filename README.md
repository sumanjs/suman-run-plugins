## About

Each plugin is versioned separately - as each plugin is published separately to NPM, like so:

`@suman-run-plugins/x`


## As a whole

You can import either:

`suman-run-plugins/plugins/x`    # will always be the latest version of all plugins, is bundled with suman

or

`@suman-run-plugins/x`           # can be installed in package.json and versioned
